                        <p><b>28/04/2023 My reason for leaving Foxwells Garden</b><br><br>Hello. My name is noelle jade, an AMAB Trans Female, 17 years old.

                            <p><b>My reason for leaving, the entire thing.</b><br><br>I feel pretty stupid for leaving. Foxwells Garden was a chance at making new friends and joining a nerdy group where I would fit in. I heavily apologise about my shitty argument and petty leaving of the server.</br><br>I know this shouldnt be used as an excuse but I would like to explain why I have been so immature as of late. I have been having mental issues regarding a crappy situation at home. I have been having lots of suicidal thoughts lately to the point where I was ready to do it... That and my average mental issues and autism all built up and made me act more immature than usual.<br><br>This mixed with the fact that i cannot get ANY support regarding my gender dysphoria due to a transphobic family really doesnt bode well on the mind.<br><br>So again i apologise and i hope i may be able to fit in better and be less immature. Im sorry.</p>
